# for-fun-c

Just for fun

This repo is a compilation of curious or funny pieces of code in C or C++, mostly with strange or unexpected results

- **indetermined_sum.c:** This one creates two functions that apparently don't do anything and combining them manages to implement an addition of two integers. The unexpected behavior can be compiler-dependant, but you may try it in your computer.

```bash
$ gcc -o indetermined_sum indetermined_sum.c
$ ./indetermined_sum 12 473
Sum is: 485
Do you know what just happened? And why?
```
